# Introduction:

We are going to analysis sentiments of comments from <a href = 'https://www.trustpilot.com/'>Trustpilot</a> page for french language using CamemBert model and PyTorch. 

The project consists of three tasks:

1. The first one is to scrape the comments and reviews from Trustpilot page by each category (or all categories together). 

2. The second one is to preprocess, clean and prepare data for CamemBERT model.

3. The third one is a sentiment analysis task. Sentiment analysis, in this case, consists of classifying the opinion of a sentence whether it is positive or negative.
